    "### Objectives \n",
    "The objectives of this tutorial are:\n",
    "1. To familiarise with the process by which power engineers can run a **power flow** for a given **low voltage (LV) distribution network**. To achieve this, you will learn the basics of how to model an LV distribution network and investigate certain aspects such as voltage regulation and energy losses.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. To continue familiarising with **advanced tools** useful to run distribution network studies involving DERs. You will continue using [OpenDSS](https://www.epri.com/pages/sa/opendss) via the [dss_python](https://github.com/dss-extensions/dss_python) module. And, to guide you, all will be done using a notebook on [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structure of this Notebook\n",
    "The rest of this notebook is divided into two parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **2. Tutorial.** Here you will learn, step by step, how to model a distribution network and analyse what-if scenarios by running power flows with OpenDSS and Python.\n",
    "- **3. Exercises.** Here you will go through some exercises that will help you familiarise with the **`code`** and how to modify it for different purposes.\n",
    "- **4. Simulation Workspace.** Here you can place all your code to run it at once. You should use **`code`** that is relevant to each exercise."
